Spring Boot Banking API - Simple Explanation**

Here's a straightforward breakdown of why each file exists and how they work together in simple terms:

1. The Big Picture
This is a banking system that:
- Stores customer accounts with balances
- Tracks different banks with their interest rates
- Calculates monthly interest automatically
- Provides a REST API for managing everything

2. File-by-File Purpose

📁 Bank.java
What it is: A blueprint for what a "Bank" looks like  
**Why it exists**:  
- Defines bank properties (name, interest rates)  
- Ensures no duplicate bank names  
- Maps to a database table called "banks"  
**Real-world analogy**: Like a bank's profile page showing its name and rates

📁 Customer.java
**What it is**: A blueprint for a "Customer Account"  
**Why it exists**:  
- Stores customer details (name, balance)  
- Links each customer to their bank  
- Contains the interest calculation logic  
**Real-world analogy**: Your bank account statement showing your balance and which bank you're with

📁 BankRepository.java / CustomerRepository.java**
**What they are**: Database assistants  
**Why they exist**:  
- Handle all database operations (save, find, delete)  
- Provide ready-made queries like "find by name"  
- No need to write SQL manually  
**Real-world analogy**: Like bank tellers who fetch or update your account info when asked

📁 DataInitializer.java
**What it is**: The system's setup crew  
**Why it exists**:  
- Runs when the app starts  
- Creates standard banks (Axis, HDFC etc.) if they don't exist  
- Prevents duplicate entries  
**Real-world analogy**: Like the bank's opening day when they set up all their standard account types

📁 AccountController.java
**What it is**: The bank's customer service desk  
**Why it exists**:  
- Handles incoming API requests (like a web form)  
- Creates new accounts  
- Lists all customers  
- Calculates interest for everyone  
**Real-world analogy**: The bank's website or app interface where you do transactions

📁 application.properties
**What it is**: The system's instruction manual  
**Why it exists**:  
- Tells the app how to connect to MySQL  
- Configures how the database should behave  
- Turns on/off developer features like SQL logging  
**Real-world analogy**: Like the IT department's setup guide for the bank's computers

3. How They Work Together

1. **When you start the app**:
   - DataInitializer creates the banks table with standard banks
   - Hibernate creates the customers table

2. **When you create an account (POST request)**:
   ```
   Request → AccountController → Checks BankRepository → Saves to CustomerRepository → Database
   ```

3. **When calculating interest**:
   ```
   Request → AccountController → Gets all customers → Updates each balance → Saves changes
   ```

4. **Database operations**:
   - All data automatically saved to MySQL
   - No duplicate banks allowed
   - All customer-bank connections maintained

## **4. Real-World Workflow Example**

**Scenario**: John opens an account with ₹50,000 at Axis Bank

1. **You send**:  
   `POST /api/accounts?name=John&bank=Axis Bank&deposit=50000`

2. **System**:  
   - Checks if Axis Bank exists (via BankRepository)  
   - Creates new customer record  
   - Links John to Axis Bank  
   - Saves everything  

3. **Next month**:  
   - System calculates interest automatically  
   - John's balance grows based on Axis Bank's rates  

## **5. Why This Structure Works Well**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Entities define what data looks like
   - Repositories handle data storage
   - Controllers manage communication

2. **Safety Features**:
   - No duplicate banks
   - All transactions are tracked
   - Automatic error handling

3. **Easy to Expand**:
   - Add new banks? Just update DataInitializer
   - New customer fields? Just edit Customer.java
   - New API features? Add to Controller

This structure keeps everything organized while handling all the banking operations automatically through the API.
